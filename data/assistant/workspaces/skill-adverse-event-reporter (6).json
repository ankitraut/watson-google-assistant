Do I need patient name, what information and how do i go back in doing something which specifically I guess like this because it has happened I guess over several months ago and he's just on telling me about it now thinks its our cement for an implant that he's using which is not ours.\" He said all 6 patients were at the same hospital-which only had DePuy cement available. The surgeon has since asked for a competitor cement to be available for use. The surgeon said he might be able to get part/lot information and dates. If he is unable he will reply as such."

It was planned initially to replace only the tibial insert or replacing by other company's implants due to instability at medial side of the patient's knee right joint. Although the surgeon explanted the tibial insert (P/N: unknown), and attempted trial reposition with the tibial insert trial, the surgeon recognized that the instruments did not fit because LCS Complete were prepared in error instead of LCS Universal. Since the implants were also mistakenly prepared by the LCS complete so the surgeon gave up on replacing the tibial insert.

The surgery was completed without a surgical delay. As for Dr?s view, there was a possibility that the fracture occurred because the Corail stem was inserted in the retrotorsion, the final rasp position and the insertion position might change if the Corail collared stem was inserted as there was no merkmal for antetorsion adjustment. Possible cause: there was a possibility by selecting the High Offset Stem that the gluteus maximus was pulled, a torsional stress was added, and the fracture occurred.

Zsolt described it as tight unevenly through the cutting slot. The event occurred at approx 2 pm on the 28/1/19. They tired a different blade with the same result. It was then established that it must be the cutting block which may be at fault. Looking at the cutting block afterwards JJM Rep could see that the metal surfaces on the cutting slot are burred. See attached photo. The procedure could be continued with this cutting block, it just made it harder than would be expected. Patient outcome was successful.
